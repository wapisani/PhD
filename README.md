# Ph.D. Dissertation Appendix B: LAMMPS, Python, R, MAC/GMC, etc. Scripts and Data Files

## What is this?
---
This repository contains a portion of the many, many scripts I have written and data files I have generated. 

## Organization
---
The LAMMPS scripts and data files are organized by chapter and then by methodology stage. The MAC/GMC files will be under chapter 4. The Python and R scripts are largely independent of chapter and so are in their own folders at the root of the repository. 

## Why is Chapter 5 devoid of life?
---
The entirety of chapter 5 has the potential to be [export-controlled](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations) someday and so this is a necessary precaution. If I receive notice that chapter 5 can be released to the public, then that directory will be updated with the relevant scripts and data files. 

## How do I use script X?
---


## What software versions do I need to run x?
---
All Python scripts were written for Python 2.7. They will likely need to be updated for the latest 3.x version. All Python scripts were meant to be run inside an IDE like Spyder or PyCharm. R scripts will likely work with the latest versions of R and R studio. The LAMMPS scripts were written for a variety of versions, but they will likely work with the latest version of LAMMPS.
